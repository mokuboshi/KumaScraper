# PythonProjects

I'm never really used Python before and I've wanted to try it out for a while. 
As a personal curiousity I've been tracking how fast I can read chapters of a Web Novel, Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear, to see if I can track any improvements.

I made this to get a character count for each Kuma Kuma Kuma Bear chapter off of Syosetu, but in its current state it isn't too accurate.

Need to figure out:
  How to remove punctuation before count to make account more accurate.
  Figure out why some chapters come up as '0'.
